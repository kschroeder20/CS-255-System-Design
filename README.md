# CS-255-System-Design

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- DriverPass is a company whose purpose is to provide people with better driver training. They wanted a system to provide a more comprehensive education to driving students that will help them pass their tests.


## What did you do particularly well?
- One thing that I did well during this project was my ability to digest a lot of client input and mold it into a list of tangible goals for the system.


## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I’d revise the security portion of the document. As I move through the Computer Science curriculum at SNHU, I will be taking more security-based courses which could make me aware of relevant cyber attacks that I am not thinking about currently.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- Considering the user is very important because they are the ones who are going to be using the system. We need to create a system that adheres to their needs so that they continue to use it and recommend it to others. I interpreted their needs by listening to our client and diagraming use cases to think through the user interactions with the site.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- I approach designing by software by looking at the system as a whole, then narrowing my scope. What I mean by this is that I like to do a lot of research about what the client and the user want out of this system before working on technical requirements. After I have a good understanding of the client’s goals, I’ll work through technical requirements and fully think through the different functionalities and what that will look like in the code. Then I’ll think through use cases to make sure that the system is designed in a way that prevents bugs.
